# xjs.js

## WARNING: The framework is currently in an early development phase and many things could change or disappear in the future.

xjs is a personal JavaScript framework created based on my needs and my working style.
Although it is not intended for general use, I explain its structure and functionalities below.

## Structure

It consists of two parts:
* 1. Extension of base JavaScript and DOM objects (Element, HTMLElement, Node, CSSStyleDeclaration, String)
* 2. xjs class that defines various creation, selection and modification of elements functions as well as other string, math, array utilities.

To see an example of use, you can see the file index.html or see the functional demo at https://ryddle.github.io/xjs/index.html
